<h2 align="center">What Are Bottom Dwellers?</h2>

<p align="center">
  <strong>Bottom Dwellers</strong> is an NFT collection built on Radix that humorously explores mythical family dynamics and the struggle for identity and purpose in a modern context.
</p>

<p align="center">
  These degenerate sons reflect Poseidon's adventurous love life, often finding themselves ensnared by rather unconventional partners lurking at the bottom of the deep.
</p>

<p align="center">
  Despite their carefree attitudes and longing to impress Poseidon, they know they will never live up to his expectations.

  The collection hilariously explores mythical family dynamics and the struggle for identity and purpose in a modern context.
